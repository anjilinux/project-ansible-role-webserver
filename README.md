Ansible Role: Webserver (Nginx OR Apache)
=========

This role installs and configure a webserver. For the moment, this role only manages *Nginx* OR *Apache* (you can choose which one to install using a variable).

The following actions are performed:
- Install the latest version of Nginx or Apache
- Install the latest version of PHP-FPM
- Install the latest version of UFW
- Remove the default Website of the Web server
- Copy some hardened website templates to /root/
- Open the HTTP and HTTPS ports in the firewall
- Prepare the skeleton of new users to handle Websites

Role Variables
--------------

By default, this role will install and configure Nginx. However, a variable can be set to choose Apache if you want to.

Here is the variable as defined by default in this role:

```
webserver: nginx
```

If you prefer to install Apache instead of Nginx, set the value of this variable to *apache*.


Dependencies
------------

No dependencies from other roles required.
